                        <h3>Introducing Bull Bear Finance, a 13337 collectibles NFT vector pop-art collection.</h3>

                        <p><strong>Inspired by HashMasks, CryptoPunks, Pop-art, Vector graphics and obviously the
                            current
                            evolvement of the cryptocurrency space, Bull Bear Finance is ready for take-off. 13337 Vector
                            Line
                            Art drawings have been curated out of more than 272,160,000 possible combinations and
                            recorded in an
                            smart-contract engraved sequence in the smart contract on the Binance Smart Chain
                            blockchain.&nbsp;With
                            many of the NFT projects out there, super-rare collectibles are instantly snatched by
                            art-hunters.
                            In an initial three week "blind" distribution period, Bull Bear Finance owners won't know
                            which
                            artwork(s) they actually possess until the on-chain entropy based sequence shift
                            happens.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>The initial acquisition period for Bull Bear Finance starts on <strong>February 23, 2021 @
                            1:33:37 PM
                            UTC</strong> (1614087217). The initial 4000 artworks will be sold for 0.05 bnb, with a cap
                            of max 50
                            NFTs per transaction to prevent people abusing this offer. After that the price slowly ramps
                            up
                            until the last artwork is on offer for 111 bnb.</p>
                        <h4>Scalable. Vector. Graphics.</h4>
                        <p>Vector graphics, composed of lines defined by mathematical formulas, were first used in
                            computer
                            displays in the 1960s and â€™70s. They have a big advantage over raster graphics: Unlimited
                            scaleability. (hey, maybe one should develop a vector based blockchain :P). This means the
                            Bull Bear Finances NFT files can be scaled up to any size, with 100% quality reproduction. If you want
                            to print
                            your Bull Bear Finance on your 5-storey wall: no problem. Computers use the Scalable Vector
                            Graphic
                            file format for storing and displaying vector files on the web. The SVG file standard itself
                            has
                            been in development within the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999. Be sure to check
                            out the
                            provisional gallery with all 13337 artworks.</p>
                        <h4>Unique traits</h4>
                        <p>Every Bull Bear Finance has over 10 unique traits. Each of the 13337 NFTs is therefore unique.
                            And you
                            help make the artwork even more unique as collectors will be able to give it their NFT(s) a
                            name
                            using the NYR tokens which come with each Bull Bear Finance. It is what the great HashMasks
                            calls the
                            "Next Generation of Digital Art Collectibles" and Bull Bear Finance takes pride into adopting
                            this
                            uniquest of all traits: naming the artwork.</p>
                        <h4>Name Your Rocket token</h4>
                        <p>Each day, 7.37 Name Your Rocket-tokens (NYR) are accumulated by each Bull Bear Finance NFT and
                            can be
                            claimed by the current holder whenever seemed fit. Once you collect 1337 NYR (about half a
                            year
                            worth of NYR), you can burn these tokens and change the name of your Bull Bear Finance
                            on-chain. If
                            you buy a Bull Bear Finance during the first 21 days of the initial acquisition phase will
                            receive 1.5
                            year worth of NYR (3 * 1337 NYR, the equivalent of 3 name changes). After the 21 days, each
                            sold (if
                            still available) Bull Bear Finance will start with enough supply for a single name change
                            (1337
                            NYR).</p>
                        <h4>Fair distribution starts on Tuesday February 23 - 2021 # 1:33:37 PM UTC (1614087217)</h4>
                        <p>In order to prevent founders or any other art-hunter obtain the super rare Bull Bear Finance a
                            hidden
                            sale is being used. This way, initially, no one can know which artwork will be bound to
                            their NFT.
                            Once the three week period is over or the sale of 13337 NFTs concludes (whichever is
                            earlier), the
                            rocket graphic is assigned to the actual NFT. This is done by an on-chain random entropy
                            mechanism.
                            There is an initial sequence in which each NFT is hashed for the proof of the full
                            collection which
                            is displayed in the Provenance Record for Bull Bear Finance.</p>
                        <h4>Launching on Binance Smart Chain instead of Ethereum</h4>
                        <p>Bull Bear Finance NFT is launching on the Binance Smart Chain. <b>BSC offers a viable
                            alternative to
                            the relatively high fee state of Ethereum as of now</b>. Bull Bear Finance aims to be an "art
                            for
                            everyone" model, in which the earliest artworks are minted for a fraction of the costs of
                            the last
                            (20,000x). The Binance Smart Chain supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine and therefore the
                            Bull Bear Finances smart contracts are interchangeable. Should the Bull Bear Finance community in a
                            later phase
                            like to swap to Ethereum, after a governance based vote, the Tenens Fortens DAO is willing
                            to
                            snapshot the state of the project onto Ethereum, but the aim is to have one of the first
                            full
                            fledged dynamic NFTs on Binance Smart Chain.</p>
