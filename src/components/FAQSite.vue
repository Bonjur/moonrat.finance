                    Questions</h2><h6>How do I know which Bull Bear Finance I am buying?</h6>
                    <p> During the initial acquisition phase of 3 weeks, you don’t. . Only after the 3 week period is
                        over or the sale concludes (whichever is earlier), the rocket is assigned to your NFT. This is
                        done by an on-chain random entropy mechanism. The sale is purposely hidden in order to avoid the
                        founders or anyone else to buy the rarest NFTs themselves. There is an initial sequence in which
                        each NFT is hashed for the <a href="https://lilmoonrockets.com/provenance.html">proof of the
                            full collection</a>. The actual sequence is determined after the initial sale period through
                        a randomized starting index. </p>
                    <p> So if the starting index is 8888, NFT #0 Bull Bear Finance would get the artwork of the 8888th
                        from the initial sequence. <a href="https://lilmoonrockets.com/provenance.html">Check the
                            provenance document</a> for the complete formula to retrieve the correct artwork with a
                        token. The random starting index is determined by either the first mint transaction after the
                        reveal period or the mint transaction of the last NFT, i.e Bull Bear Finance #13337 (whichever is
                        earlier). </p><h6>Will I be able to trade the Bull Bear Finances after the sale?</h6>
                    <p> The Bull Bear Finances follow the ERC-721 standard and, as such, can be transferred freely amongst
                        Binance Smart Chain wallets. We will not provide a secondary market place for Bull Bear Finances
                        on this website and have no control over users creating secondary markets for the LiL Moon
                        Rockets on third-party websites. </p><h6>Price Slip: What if i mint Bull Bear Finances just before
                        the price tier ends?</h6>
                    <p> If you mint more than one Bull Bear Finance near the end of price tier, there's a chance of price
                        slip. So for example, let's say the current supply is 3999 (1 left for price change from 0.05 to
                        0.1), if you mint 10 rockets at this point, you would be able to get all of them for the old
                        price of 0.05. Better for simplicity and helps avoiding too many reverted transactions at the
                        end of each price tier. </p><h6>How much does a Bull Bear Finance cost?</h6>
                    <p> There is an increasing pricing schedule for the Bull Bear Finances. You can see the pricing on the
                        homepage. Note that it is subject to a possibility of price slip as described in the section
                        above. </p><h6>How can I get more NYRs?</h6>
                    <p> There is only two ways to get more NYRs: Hold one or more Bull Bear Finance and accumulate 10 NYRs
                        per day per NFT, Receive NYRs from another wallet. The website does not provide a market place
                        for NYRs. We have no control over the user’s usage of the NYR token on third-party websites. Any
                        markets for NYRs are not associated with the website itself. </p><h6>How do I know how rare my
                        Bull Bear Finance is?</h6>
                    <p> The rarity of each trait is revealed after the initial distribution period. You can click
                        through the gallery to look at all the 13337 digital portraits to see if you can detect patterns
                        or other hidden traits. </p><h6> How can I name my Bull Bear Finance Nebuchadnezzar II, if another
                        Bull Bear Finance already owns the name?</h6>
                    <p> You will not be able to choose a name that already exists. In addition, there is no case
                        sensitivity and no leading or trailing spaces. In order to be able to name your Bull Bear Finance
                        Nebuchadnezzar II, you would need to purchase the current Nebuchadnezzar II from his/her owner,
                        change the name of the current Nebuchadnezzar II to Discovery and then you could name some other
                        Bull Bear Finance Nebuchadnezzar II.</p><h6>When can I name my Bull Bear Finances?</h6>
                    <p> You will be able to claim your NYRs (and the bonus NYRs) immediately after the purchase of the
                        NFT. You will be able to name any NFT you own immediately after the purchase. You will not know
                        the styling or hiker type of your NFT, though, so you could accidentally give a moontravelling
                        Yieldfarmer a name for a moontravelling Facepalm. </p><h6>Will others see my Bull Bear Finances on
                        the website?</h6>
                    <p> Yes. The current gallery changes once the initial distribution period is over and will allow you

                    <p> Yes, you can. You own the NFT. As the private key holder of the wallet that owns the NFT, you
